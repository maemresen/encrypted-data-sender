The main motivation is simulating an encrypted communication between sender and listener.

Modules:
* listener: simulates the listener side that receives encrypted messages and decrypts
* sender: simulates the sned side that encyrpt messages and send them to listner
* securelib: helper library that is using by both listener and sender modules  


# Usage
1. First you should statrt **listener** module.
2. Second you start **sender** module.
3. Follow console outputs on both listener and sender. You will see mock data 
    * encrypted on sender
    * decrypted on listener
